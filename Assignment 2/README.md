In this assignment, I'll be working with Python to conduct comprehensive data analysis tasks. 
Firstly, I'll compute and display summary statistics for each feature in the dataset, including essential metrics like minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and percentiles. 
Then, I'll move on to data visualization, creating histograms to visually represent feature distributions, aiding in better comprehension of the dataset's characteristics. 
Furthermore, I'll tackle data cleaning, integration, and transformation, followed by building a classification model. 
These tasks will equip me with practical skills in data handling and analysis, preparing me for real-world scenarios where data-driven decision-making is paramount. 
Through this assignment, I aim to strengthen my Python proficiency and deepen my understanding of data analysis techniques.
