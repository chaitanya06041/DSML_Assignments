Welcome to the Predicting Customer Response for Special Offers in a Cosmetics Shop project! In this project, we aim to utilize machine learning (ML) techniques to predict customer responses to special offers in a cosmetics shop. By analyzing details of customers, we seek to understand their behavior and preferences, enabling the shop to tailor offers effectively and enhance customer engagement.
