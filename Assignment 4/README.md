In data analysis and machine learning, clustering algorithms play a vital role in organizing unlabeled data into meaningful groups based on similarities among data points. One such popular clustering algorithm is k-means clustering, which aims to partition a dataset into k distinct clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid. In this assignment, we explore the application of k-means clustering to a collection of 8 points denoted as P1 through P8. The objective is to group these points into two clusters using the k-means algorithm, with initial centroids assigned to specific points. Specifically, we initialize the centroids as m1 = P1 (Cluster #1) and m2 = P8 (Cluster #2), and subsequently perform the clustering process. Through this exercise, we aim to determine the cluster assignments for individual data points, calculate the population of a cluster centered around a specified centroid, and update the centroids based on the iterative nature of the k-means algorithm. By applying k-means clustering to the given dataset, we seek to gain insights into the inherent structure and patterns within the data, showcasing the effectiveness of this algorithm in unsupervised learning tasks.
