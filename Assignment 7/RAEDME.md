In the realm of education, particularly for aspiring students seeking admission to foreign universities, the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) holds significant importance as a standardized test. Alongside various other factors such as TOEFL scores, university ratings, statement of purpose strength, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, and research experience, the GRE score plays a pivotal role in determining admission outcomes.

The dataset provided contains a comprehensive collection of attributes for each student, including GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and more. Moreover, it includes a binary target variable, 'Admitted', indicating whether a student was admitted (1) or not (0) to the university.

The objective of this assignment is to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically classification algorithms, to predict admission outcomes based on GRE scores and academic performance. In particular, we focus on building a decision tree classifier to assist a counselor in making informed decisions regarding student admissions.

The assignment entails the following steps:

a) Data Pre-processing: If necessary, we will apply techniques such as label encoding and data transformation to prepare the dataset for model training.

b) Data Preparation: We will split the data into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation and validation.

c) Machine Learning Algorithm: Utilizing the decision tree classification algorithm, we will build a predictive model capable of determining whether a student will be admitted based on their GRE score and academic performance.

d) Model Evaluation: Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

By undertaking this assignment, we aim to empower counselors and educational institutions with a robust predictive model that can aid in the admissions decision-making process. Through the application of machine learning algorithms and rigorous evaluation, we strive to provide actionable insights to guide informed decisions and support student aspirations of pursuing higher education abroad.
