Regression analysis is a fundamental technique in data science and statistics used for predicting continuous outcomes based on one or more predictor variables. In this assignment, we delve into the realm of regression techniques by exploring temperature data from India. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, provides monthly average temperatures recorded across various locations in India, with temperature values reported in Celsius.

The primary objectives of this assignment are as follows:

a) Apply Linear Regression: Using a suitable library function, we aim to implement a linear regression model to predict month-wise temperatures. By leveraging the inherent relationships within the dataset, we seek to develop a model that can effectively estimate temperatures based on the provided features.

b) Performance Assessment: In evaluating the efficacy of our regression models, we employ key performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (R^2). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy, precision, and goodness of fit of the regression models, enabling us to assess their predictive capabilities.

c) Visualization of Regression Model: Through visualization, we aim to elucidate the relationships between predictor variables and the target variable (temperature). By plotting the regression line alongside the actual data points, we can gain a visual understanding of how well the model captures the underlying patterns and trends in the data.

By embarking on this assignment, we aim to not only apply regression techniques to real-world data but also to gain insights into the temperature trends in India and evaluate the performance of our predictive models rigorously. Through the combined use of statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and visualization techniques, we strive to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and enhance our understanding of temperature variations across different months in India.
